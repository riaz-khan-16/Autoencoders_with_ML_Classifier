To update your repository, follow these steps:

                        git branch
                        git checkout <branch-name>

Make sure you are on the branch you want to update.
You can use the 'git branch' command to check which branch you are currently on,
and the 'git checkout <branch-name>' command to switch to a different branch if necessary.

                                git add .
                                or 
                                git add <file-name>



Use 'git add .' to stage all the changes you want to commit. 
Alternatively, you can use 'git add <file-name>' to stage specific files.



                       git commit -m "commit message"



Use 'git commit -m "commit message"' to commit the changes.
 Replace "commit message" with a brief description of the changes you made.

                           
                           git pull origin main --rebas



Use 'git pull origin main --rebase' to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and
 apply them to your local repository. 
 The --rebase option is used to incorporate your local changes into the updated history of the branch.

If there are any conflicts during the rebase process, resolve them by editing the affected files,
 using git add <file-name> to stage the resolved changes, and continuing the rebase process with 
 git rebase --continue.


                           git push origin <branch-name>

Use git push origin <branch-name> to push your changes to the remote repository.
 Replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to push to.

After you have pushed your changes, 
your remote repository should be updated with your latest changes.
